mg
==
This is a portable version of the Mg editor from OpenBSD by the OpenBSD
developer who recently did a bunch of overhaul work on the version of Mg
found in the OpenBSD base system.

Mg is intended to be a small, fast, and portable editor for people who
can't (or don't want to) run emacs for one reason or another, or are not
familiar with the vi editor.  It is compatible with emacs because there
shouldn't be any reason to learn more editor types than emacs or vi.
